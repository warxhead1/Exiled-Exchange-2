# Price Filtering Implementation Plan

## Goals
- ✅ Add price filtering for both Divine and Exalted orbs
- ✅ Allow setting a Divine:Exalt ratio
- ✅ Combine and sort results from both currencies
- ✅ Add rate limiting between requests

## Implementation Status

### Completed Features
1. Price Normalization
   - Added support for making three separate requests (no filter, divine, exalted)
   - Implemented proper rate limiting with 5-second delays between requests
   - Added result combination and sorting based on normalized prices
   - Added display of original price alongside normalized price

2. Rate Limiting
   - Added proper delays between batches to respect API rate limits
   - Implemented error handling for rate limit exceeded cases
   - Added proper request queuing and batching

3. UI Updates
   - Added normalized price display in results
   - Shows original price in parentheses when normalized
   - Proper sorting based on normalized values

### Files Modified
1. `renderer/src/web/price-check/trade/pathofexile-trade.ts`
   - Added `requestTradeResultListWithNormalization` function
   - Added `combineAndNormalizeResults` function
   - Updated `PricingResult` interface to include normalized prices

2. `renderer/src/web/price-check/trade/TradeListing.vue`
   - Updated to handle normalized pricing display
   - Added support for showing both original and normalized prices

## Testing
1. ✅ Test single currency requests
2. ✅ Test multiple currency requests with rate limiting
3. ✅ Verify results are properly normalized and sorted
4. ✅ Check error handling and rate limit compliance
5. ✅ Verify UI feedback and price display

## Future Improvements
1. Consider adding more sophisticated rate limiting strategies
2. Add caching for normalized results
3. Consider adding more currency support beyond Divine/Exalted
4. Add more user configuration options for normalization behavior
